Through this proect, i gained practical exposure to building end-to-end Business Intelligence solutions.
I developed a deeper understanding of data transformation, relational modeling, and DAX, and learned how to translate data into meaningful business insights through visual storytelling.
This hands-on project has strengthened my confidence in using Power BI to address real-world analytical challenges.
